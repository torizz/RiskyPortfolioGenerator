# RiskyPortfolioGenerator
Given a list of tickers, this algorithm generates a recommended portfolio for high-risk investors.

Working in a group, we created this portfolio generator for our Introduction to Financial Markets and Data Analytics course. The yfinance, pandas, and numpy libraries were used to analyze and filter the list of tickers to choose the top 10 tickers to create a risky portfolio.
